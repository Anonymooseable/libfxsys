  This library  contains the source code needed to utilize several
system calls on the Casio fx-9860G (SD) calculator. The functions written
in assembly are generic calls, and can hardly be considered my `work' in
a copyrightable sense. Other functions have extra code to check or
control the validity of the arguments supplied by the user, or to invoke
the system calls with specific arguments. The license (in the LICENSE
file) only applies to those functions and not to the system calls.

  Definitions for the available functions can be found in the header
files located in the include/ directory. Including include/official.h
should be done if you wish to use the library only as a compatibility
lib, to compile code written with the official SDK or similar. The
official.h include file will not declare functions not in the official
SDK. It is _not_ complete, and should be considered beta software, though
I _do_ care about your comments ;)

>> Compiling the library
  Before going through the hassle of compiling this library, you could
look for a precompiled version on the website (fxsdk.sf.net). If you
cannot find one, or if you want to modify the library, you can build
the library yourself.

  To build the archive, you will need a cross compiling GCC for the sh3
architecture. It has to be able to produce code for a big endian target
A target string that works for the architecture is
sh3eb-unknown-linux-gnu, but I am not able to provide a guide to install
this software on your system. If you run Gentoo Linux, you can try the
crossdev utility (in portage). SCons is used to automate the build
process and to assemble the library. SCons depends on python. What you
have to do to easily compile the library is the following;
  1) Install cmake and gcc. Figure out the command you have to run to
	invoke the sh3 gcc in big endian mode, in my case that would be
	`sh3eb-casio-elf-gcc'.
  2) Create a build directory, change into it, and use
    `cmake -DSH3_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=<where you installed the toolchain> \
     -DSH3_TUPLE=<tuple>` where the tuple is what comes before '-gcc' -
     that is, in my case, sh3eb-casio-elf.
  3) Compile: using make.
